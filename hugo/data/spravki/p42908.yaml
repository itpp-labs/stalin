  spravka: "He was born in Hungary. He is a Soviet citizen, a journalist. He was a\
    \ member of the CP of Hungary between 1918 and 1925, a member of the VKP(b) between\
    \ 1925 and 1933, and a member of the CP of Hungary in 1933-1935. \n  In the country\
    \ [Hungary], he conducted active revolutionary work. He was arrested several times\
    \ and, in 1922, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In 1924, he came to the USSR\
    \ after an exchange [of political prisoners]. \n  Between 1926 and 1927, Komor\
    \ worked for the Foreign Committee of the CC CP of Hungary in Moscow. In 1927-33,\
    \ Komor again worked in Moscow. \n  In 1933-1935, Komor worked for the CC CP of\
    \ Hungary which was dissolved in 1936 by the decision of the ECCI’s Secretariat\
    \ for sabotaging the implementation of the decisions of the VII Comintern Congress,\
    \ for gross violation of the rules of conspiracy, for clamping down on self-criticism,\
    \ and for the presence of Hungarian police agents in the CC. \n  However, it is\
    \ clear, from ECCI apparatus documents, that when KOMOR learned about the behavior\
    \ of the Hungarian delegation (Kun and Gross) at the VII Congress and about [their]\
    \ sabotage in implementing the decisions of the VII Congress, he informed the\
    \ ECCI leadership about it.[lxiv] \n  The representative of the CP of Hungary\
    \ in the ECCI thinks that “Komor has serious shortcomings, that he is a rather\
    \ light-minded and somewhat superficial man…, but an honest communist and a talented\
    \ person… He conducted a decisive struggle against the Trotskyist-Bukharinist\
    \ gang.” \n  He was arrested in July 1937[lxv] by NKVD organs and, on 23. X. 1939,\
    \ the Special NKVD Council sentenced him to 8 years in a corrective labor camp\
    \ for participating in the rightist-Trotskyist organization. \n  For more than\
    \ two years, the case of Komor-Katsburg was under investigation. The Military\
    \ Board of the Supreme Court of the USSR heard this case three times, and each\
    \ time it remitted it for further inquiry. As stated in the letter from the Deputy\
    \ Procurator of the USSR of 19. IX. [19]40, No. 61419, Komor-Katsburg “has been\
    \ exposed by testimony of Kreichi, [lxvi] Bela Kun, Ersh, [lxvii] Magyar, and\
    \ others.” \n  The reference letter from the Cadres Department of 15. IV. 1940\
    \ points out that Komor-Katsburg “in his speeches at the sessions of the CC CP\
    \ of Hungary in December 1935, and at the meetings with c. Ercoli in March 1936,\
    \ criticized the sectarian policies of Kun and Gross in the CP of Hungary, and\
    \ their unscrupulous behavior at the VII ECCI Congress.” \n  We sent exhaustive\
    \ information about Komor-Katsburg on 14. XI. [19]39, 21. XI. [19]39, and on 17.\
    \ IV. [19]40 under No. 991. \n  In his reply of 19. XII. [19]40, No. 61419, the\
    \ Deputy Procurator of the USSR indicated that there was no reason to review the\
    \ case, and the complaint remained uresolved.[lxviii]"
