  spravka: "(January 2, 1874 – December 31, 1938) was a Georgian military officer\
    \ who served in the armies of the Russian Empire and Democratic Republic of Georgia.\
    \ He was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge. \n  Jijikhia attended the Tiflis\
    \ Theological Seminary, but joined the Imperial Russian military in 1893. He graduated\
    \ from the Tiflis Infantry Junker School in 1897 and received a podporuchik’s\
    \ commission in Turkestan where he spent several years and authored several works\
    \ on Bukhara, including a comprehensive and reliable account of the 1910 Shia-Sunni\
    \ clashes in the region. \n  In 1910, Jijikhia, already a captain, was transferred\
    \ in Congress Poland to serve in the staff of the 6th Infantry Division and then\
    \ of the 15th Army Corps in which he served during World War I. He took part in\
    \ the Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914) and was captured by the Germans\
    \ in the Battle of Tannenberg (1914). Once released, he joined the army of the\
    \ newly established and initially German-friendly independent Georgian republic\
    \ in 1918 and was promoted to major general in 1919. During the Soviet Russian\
    \ offensive against the Georgian capital of Tiflis in 1921, he commanded an attack\
    \ force of 5 People’s Guard battalions and a cavalry brigade which successfully\
    \ defended the approaches to the capital, but the battle was ultimately lost and\
    \ Georgia became a Soviet republic. Jijikhia became victim of the Stalinist purges\
    \ in 1938."
