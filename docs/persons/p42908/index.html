        He was born in Hungary. He is a Soviet citizen, a journalist. He was a member of the CP of Hungary between 1918 and 1925, a member of the VKP(b) between 1925 and 1933, and a member of the CP of Hungary in 1933-1935.<br/>In the country [Hungary], he conducted active revolutionary work. He was arrested several times and, in 1922, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In 1924, he came to the USSR after an exchange [of political prisoners].<br/>Between 1926 and 1927, Komor worked for the Foreign Committee of the CC CP of Hungary in Moscow. In 1927-33, Komor again worked in Moscow.<br/>In 1933-1935, Komor worked for the CC CP of Hungary which was dissolved in 1936 by the decision of the ECCI’s Secretariat for sabotaging the implementation of the decisions of the VII Comintern Congress, for gross violation of the rules of conspiracy, for clamping down on self-criticism, and for the presence of Hungarian police agents in the CC.<br/>However, it is clear, from ECCI apparatus documents, that when KOMOR learned about the behavior of the Hungarian delegation (Kun and Gross) at the VII Congress and about [their] sabotage in implementing the decisions of the VII Congress, he informed the ECCI leadership about it.[lxiv]<br/>The representative of the CP of Hungary in the ECCI thinks that “Komor has serious shortcomings, that he is a rather light-minded and somewhat superficial man…, but an honest communist and a talented person… He conducted a decisive struggle against the Trotskyist-Bukharinist gang.”<br/>He was arrested in July 1937[lxv] by NKVD organs and, on 23. X. 1939, the Special NKVD Council sentenced him to 8 years in a corrective labor camp for participating in the rightist-Trotskyist organization.<br/>For more than two years, the case of Komor-Katsburg was under investigation. The Military Board of the Supreme Court of the USSR heard this case three times, and each time it remitted it for further inquiry. As stated in the letter from the Deputy Procurator of the USSR of 19. IX. [19]40, No. 61419, Komor-Katsburg “has been exposed by testimony of Kreichi, [lxvi] Bela Kun, Ersh, [lxvii] Magyar, and others.”<br/>The reference letter from the Cadres Department of 15. IV. 1940 points out that Komor-Katsburg “in his speeches at the sessions of the CC CP of Hungary in December 1935, and at the meetings with c. Ercoli in March 1936, criticized the sectarian policies of Kun and Gross in the CP of Hungary, and their unscrupulous behavior at the VII ECCI Congress.”<br/>We sent exhaustive information about Komor-Katsburg on 14. XI. [19]39, 21. XI. [19]39, and on 17. IV. [19]40 under No. 991.<br/>In his reply of 19. XII. [19]40, No. 61419, the Deputy Procurator of the USSR indicated that there was no reason to review the case, and the complaint remained uresolved.[lxviii]
